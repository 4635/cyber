								<h2>University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center
									Sr. Research Scientist
								</h2>
								<p>Advanced Technology Genomics Core (ATGC)</p>
								<p> •	Executed RNA library preparation, including TruSeq stranded total RNA, TruSeq stranded mRNA, low input mRNA, and low input total RNA.</p>
								<p> •	Performed quantification by qPCR and checked for quality using Agilent TapeStation.</p>
								<p> •	Denatured sample and loaded flow cell into cartrage in sequencing instruments (NovaSeq 6000, NextSeq 500, HiSeq 4000/3000, MiSeq500/550, iSeq 100).</p>
								<p> •	De-multiplexed and converted the base-call data to fastq file. </p>
								<p> •	Analyzed data for bulk mRNA-Seq and total RNA-Seq for Bam files, FPKM value, and differential expression comparison using Python.</p>
								<p> •	Built up Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) to increase work efficiency and reduce biological errors.</p>
								<h2>The University of Texas Health Science Center 
									Research Scientist
								</h2>
								<p>Center for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine and tissue engineering</p>
								<p>Department of Neurosurgery </p>
								<p>Project: Functional neuronal differentiation of injury-induced muscle-derived stem cell-like cells with therapeutic implications</p>
								<p> •	Injured skeletal muscle stem cells (iMuSCs) from TA muscle were isolated using the preplating method.</p>
								<p> •	Undifferentiated iMuSCs were cultured in the Neural Stem Cell medium to form the neurosphere, confirmed by immunocytochemistry and qPCR on neuronal marker expression.</p>
								<p> •	The iMuSCs in neurogenic differentiation medium could induce mature and functional neural phenotypes, evaluated by whole-cell patch-clamp recording.</p>
								<p> •	Transplantation of iMuSCs into mdx mice (a murine model representing Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy) were harvested for histological and qPCR analysis 1 and 3 weeks after injection.</p>
								<p> •	Transplantation of iMuSCs and iMuSC extract in mdx mice improved neuromuscular junction morphology by more dense aggregates and number of segments of ACHRs.</p>
								<h2>University of Houston 
									Postdoctoral fellowship </h2>
								<p>Department of Pharmacological and Pharmaceutical Sciences</p>
							
								<p>Project: Screening and characterization of small molecular inhibitors of oncogenes or genes, such as MDM2, MDMX, β-catenin both in vitro and in mice model</p>
								<p>(1)	Cell lines : NB1691 (mdm2 amp, p53 wt), NB1643, LA1-55N (mdm2 amp, p53 null, MYCN amp), LA1-5S (mdm2 OE, p53 null), NB1 (MYCN amp, alk amp, p53 wt), HepG2, Huh7 Hep3B, U87MG-Luc, were cultured for drug batch.
									•	Cell viability assay (by MTT or cell number counting), apoptosis assy, qPCR, and western blot were examined.
									</p>
								<p> (2)	xenograft, orthotopic, and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) (4~6 wks mice, NB1691-Luc), and dose and routes: 40mg/kg/day (i.p.) were applied.
									•	Various tissues (lungs, brain, heart, liver, spleen, GI, and kidneys) were removed, fixed, cryosectioned, (H&E) stained, and performed immunohistochemistry. 
									•	The extracted organs and tissues were examined by qPCR and western blot.
